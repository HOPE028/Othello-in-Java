# Othello-in-Java
Japanese game Othello created in Java. (Two player)

All explanations of how the code works are done in the actual files of the code. 

Summary:
  The game is created in a object-oriented fashion. It contains three classes: Driver, Player, and Board.
  The game ends when there are no possible spots left to put a piece.
  If a player has no possible moves but there are still remaining spots left on the board, that player's turn is skipped.
